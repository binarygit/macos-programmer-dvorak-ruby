Programmer Dvorak
=================

A keyboard layout to embody Programmer Dvorak <https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/>

Programmer Dvorak project file is in [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) format, where you can modify the layout as you please.

One feature of this particular format is that turning on CAPS lock will temporarily change the number row back to "normal", which I've found useful to enter in PINs, etc..
